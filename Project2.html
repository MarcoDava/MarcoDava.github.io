                Timeline : November 2024 - December 2024<br>
                In this project, our team was tasked to create an application using C. We decided to create the 
                middle eastern card game called Basra. What made us choose this game is the complicated 
                rules that would be interesting to implement in code. <br><br>
                
                I was in charge of merging the teams code together and thinking of the overall solution. I instructed 
                the team on how they would make their code so that the merging of the code would be seemless. <br><br>

                Our team agreed the best way to distribute and moniter team progress was having our own branches.
                This method allowed me to inform my teammates if something is incorrect. We made use of C programming 
                structure by splitting methods into multiple .c files and linking through the .h files. We also used
                dynamic array allocation to allow us to have control over the array and preventing memory leaks. <br><br>
            </p>

                Originally, our project was going to be on the GUI instead of the console. We delegated a single person to 
                do majority of the GUI and the 3 of us would work on the main functions of the game. We learned the workload 
                was extremely inbalanced and we had underestimated the difficulty of the implementation of the GUI. This 
                shortsight forced us to improvise and pivot to a console version of the game for the sake of the project deadline. 
                <br><br>
                What we could have done was have more people focus on the GUI aspect. We could have also learned the GUI framework 
                beforehand to measure how feasible it is.
